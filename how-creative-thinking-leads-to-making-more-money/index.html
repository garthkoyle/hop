Nothing can be farther from the truth!<br><br>Whether you‚Äôre working in an office, or in a shop, or practicing your profession, you are most likely creative in how you approach your day‚Äôs work.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Creativity is about going through a process to find solutions to problems.

Masterpieces of artwork are about solving a problem of how to communicate ideas, or allowing artists to express themselves, or facilitate an experience for the audience.<br><br>Creative thinking is about how you find ways to solve a problem‚Äîbig or small, no matter how mundane, like rearranging your desk or finding new ways to work, or even solving sudoku. Dismissing small improvements as not creative has made us jaded about our own levels of creativity.<br><br>But if you take a second look at these activities, you‚Äôd be surprised that you have exercised a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù bit of imagination. Why? Because it takes creativity to rearrange your desk, to organize it to be better than it was before. It takes creativity to find new ways to approach your daily tasks, to break the monotony of it all. It takes creativity to solve a sudoku puzzle, trying to fit in the numbers to arrive at the correct solution.</p><p>We are all creative. <a href="https://patch.com/us/across-america/we-are-all-born-creative">We are all born creative</a>.¬†</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f5thstejp">Tapping Into Your Creativity</h2><p>More than just creating masterpieces or finding the next big thing, creativity is how you recognize opportunities to satisfy your creative expression.

You might think this is too juvenile, but it works! More than expressing yourself, writing things down forces you to think about issues more clearly, paving that way for new ideas!<br><br>I have been keeping a journal for ten years now, and it has given me new perspectives about work and life in general. You will also see new patterns emerge that you didn't see before that will give you direction to move forward with improvements and innovation.<br><br></li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Have more fun</strong>. Games that will stimulate your imagination are highly encouraged. From puzzle-solving to brain teasers to Lego‚Ä¶take your pick! Video games (in short breaks) may also do the trick.<br><br>There are countless video and <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/531124/top-10-gaming-apps-that-will-boost-your-creativity">mobile apps designed to enhance and stimulate creativity</a>, examples of which are Dots, Jigsaw Puzzle, and Cross Fingers.<br><br>You can also ask other people to collaborate with new approaches to stimulate new ideas, and new ideas are always fun.<br><br></li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Break the monotony</strong>. All work and no play make Jack or Jill dull. Why? Because you‚Äôre on autopilot! Your brain has been programmed to do the routine to a point that you don‚Äôt think about it anymore.<br><br>You need to stimulate your thinking process. Start with small things. Like if you go to work using the same route take a new one path, exercise a new way or with new people, open yourself to new experiences.<br><br></li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Let the ideas simmer.</strong> Sometimes you can stew on a problem and fixate on certain ideas too long that your mind will get overwhelmed and become less creative. You could even sense yourself getting frustrated.<br><br>In these cases, sometimes it‚Äôs effective to go to bed or take a nap or circle back to the idea a few days later. You will be able to revisit the problem with more energy and new focus.</li></ol><p>There are other ways to stimulate creativity aside from the ones mentioned above. Some find that ‚Äúme time‚Äù helps a lot. By isolating yourself for at least a few hours (some even a day!), you meditate and unplug. It makes them take stock of themselves, think, and recharge.<br><br>Others read books as a form of relaxation. Physical exercise, especially jogging or walking outdoors, can do wonders to stimulate your creativity. Exercise can give you more energy to look for a different perspective.</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2>Improving Your Creative Thinking Process</h2><p>Process, you say?

When faced with a situation where you need to come to a decision, preparation is essential. Start by asking as many questions as you can think of. Gather old and new material that will help you come to a solution. Inundate yourself with a myriad of information about the challenge at hand.<br><br></li><li aria-level="1">Initial assessment. The¬† problem at hand may have an obvious solution. But that should not stop you from coming up with the best solution (that‚Äôs why you gathered information in Step 1). Situations also change, so is the standard answer not the right answer anymore?<br><br></li><li aria-level="1">Brainstorm. Bounce off ideas with your colleagues or friends. They have different perspectives that might help unlock the best possible solution for the challenge at hand.¬† Look for different approaches from different industries. Check the internet for other people‚Äôs approaches and feedback for more insights.<br><br></li><li aria-level="1">Identify connections. Think about how two or more topics are associated. Finding a relationship between ideas can help in understanding core issues and developing several solutions. List these combined ideas and discard those that don‚Äôt relate, and circle the core issue.<br><br></li><li aria-level="1">Apply the solutions. Testing your solutions is one way to determine which is the best one. You can then identify which solutions need improvements. The importance of testing the solutions is you can measure the results. You can calibrate them accordingly as you see fit and choose the best one. Be sure to update that journal with your findings and feedback.</li></ol><p>Now that you know the steps, you can identify which parts of the process¬† you need to improve on. For instance, when you gather information, what are your go-to sources? Google? Wikipedia? You can do better! Does your initial assessment call for more ideas?<br><br>You might be thinking of the most obvious way to go about it. But to be creative, you should think out of the box! Are you testing your ideas with the same group? Why not brainstorm with a new one?¬†</p><p>When you‚Äôve mastered these steps, the process becomes easier and more effective. Practice makes perfect!</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f5thstejq">Creative Thinking That Leads To More Money</h2><p>Now let‚Äôs get to the business side of creativity.

While having a regular day job, Zack‚Äôs been putting up businesses that deal with social media platforms and the internet of things (IoT).<br><br>Some businesses worked, some didn‚Äôt. But that did not deter him from being a serial entrepreneur; rather it taught him and prepared him his best creative ideas</p><p>Zack‚Äôs strength are his digital marketing skills which have enabled him to establish various businesses:¬† one business that builds on multiple social rewards platforms to empower digital entrepreneurs; a company involved in evaluating tech startups to jumpstart their growth and valuation before partnering with them; a firm that positions itself as a digital marketplace where advertisers meet suppliers; an esports company; and a digital news platform for entrepreneurs, to name a few.¬†</p><p>With such businesses tucked under his belt, Zack is living comfortably. And these things wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Zack didn‚Äôt use creative thinking.¬†</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2>Common Characteristics of Creative Thinkers</h2><p>When you think about it, creative thinkers share common characteristics.

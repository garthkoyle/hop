Check the list and see if some of these things should have even been bought during a pandemic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this scenario, when people spend when they should be saving, is it even possible to save money and live comfortably?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is a resounding YES.

Offhand, you can quickly identify what items you buy regularly on: major expenditures such as food, clothing, rent, etc..¬†</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But estimating general amounts does not provide adequate detail about your expenses to be helpful enough. To properly budget, you need to get an accurate picture of your expenses, and be more detailed. You need to know how much you spend on types of expenses.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c155"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record All Expenses for a Month</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father used to tell me to make a record of all the things I buy. Not only will I keep track of what I purchased, but I will be able to use that information when I start setting a budget for my future expenses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, I bought a pair of slacks in January for $30. Because I knew when I bought the clothes and how much I paid, I would know how much I will need if I need a new pair of slacks. Recording these expenses will help me plan my budget in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So yes, you need to record all monthly expenses: utility bills, groceries, gas, medicine, books, clothes--even the smallest of items you buy from the grocery store like a stick of gum or a bar of chocolate. To make sure you don‚Äôt miss any item, you may want to check your credit card statement for your purchases too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: you also need to record these expenses during a month or period of time that represents your atypical month. Avoid additional expenses that occur only during special or unique times, like tuition fees during the start of school days¬† or gifts for your family during Christmas. Then you can add the typical amount generated during those normal periods across the more unique months to account for more outflow of money during specific times of the year.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c156"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categorize Purchases</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is best if you organize your purchases in a way where you can quickly identify them‚Äîfor example, groceries, medicine, utilities, and so on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categorizing your purchases and expenses will help you correctly classify the items you bought and paid for. For instance, when you buy cereals, frozen dinners, or milk, you can put them under groceries. When you purchase a pain reliever, it goes under healthcare.¬† When you pay your cell phone plan or electric bill, you may classify them under utilities and so on.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c157"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize Needs over Wants to Satisfy More Needs</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have organized your monthly expenses, you need to classify the items in terms of</span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/financial-needs-versus-wants"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Needs versus Wants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Needs are¬† essential for you to be able to live and work. They are likely to eat up a large chunk of your paycheck‚Äîthink¬† mortgage payment, rent, or car insurance, etc</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the everyday expenses that fall under Needs:¬†</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing (rental or mortgage)</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas and transportation</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilities (cell phone plans and electricity)</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food and Groceries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare (medicine), etc.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Wants are expenses that help you live more comfortably. They refer you to things you buy for fun or leisure. They make you feel better, happier, and more fulfilled---but you don‚Äôt really need them to survive. For instance, when it comes to food, daily lunches are needs, but weekend dinners in a posh restaurant are a want.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the everyday expenses that fall under Wants:¬†</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Travel</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entertainment</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designer clothing (over basic clothing)</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memberships and subscriptions</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coffeehouse drinks</span></li></ul><p class="msg msg--highlight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classifying your expenses under Needs or Wants will make it easy for you to identify which expenses are essential and which are not and thereby how much money you can possibly save.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Utilities and Insurance go under Needs while Memberships and subscriptions (such as gym membership or premium subscription to a cable service) go under Wants.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have properly classified your needs vs wants, hopefully you have identified some of your expenditures that could be reduced or eliminated, enabling you to save more instead of spending. The money you keep could be used to prepare for the future, pay debt, or bail you out of an emergency.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c158"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifestyle Changes - Learn to Love Saving Money More than Spending Money</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider your attitude and motive for earning more money.

I bet you are surprised at how much you spend on your fast food lunches or your twice-a-day coffee-to-go from your favorite coffeehouse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, identify which activities you need to cut down on expenses. You‚Äôre not being frugal or cheap. You‚Äôre being practical.</span></p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a¬† difference between being frugal and being cheap. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being cheap is not spending money at all even on things you need---it‚Äôs not practical. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being frugal is spending money on things you do need and things you value more than other things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you really want to buy a home instead of having your favorite frappuccino twice a day, why not have it just once a day? Your daily lunches purchased from a vendor can be cut to twice a week or maybe, even once a week. Taking your lunch with you from home can also be an easy way to save a few dollars each day toward a down payment or mortgage for a house..</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might want to review your premium subscriptions to cable or streaming services. If you are streaming two brands, maybe you need to subscribe to just one cable service and do away with the streaming service or vice versa.</span><a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/9-cost-effective-alternatives-to-cable"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many cable alternatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can give you more bang for your buck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that Needs are non-negotiable; it is essential to allocate a budget for needs. As for Wants, prioritize which activities should be trimmed or cut out totally; assess which Wants are also more cost-effective than others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You‚Äôll be surprised at how much savings you will have over time as you spend less on Wants and keep more for Needs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you accumulate more money to spend on Needs and less money on Wants, you‚Äôll soon see that you are in a financially safe or strong position. That should make you feel happy and live better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy will not deprive you. You can still get to eat at your favorite diner and enjoy a cup of frappuccino at a coffee shop you frequent. You still get to buy designer clothes, or the latest mobile phone or gadget. But yo will do so on a budget you have set aside for that purpose.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c159"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budgeting for Needs and Wants</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reviewing your list of Needs and Wants, you need to know how to budget for them.¬† One helpful way to do your budgeting is through the</span><a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/50-30-20-rule#:~:text=The%2050%2F30%2F20%20rule%20budget%20is%20a%20simple%20way,savings%20or%20paying%20off%20debt."><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 50/30/20 Rule Budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50/30/20 rule calculates ‚Äúhow much money you can allocate to your needs, wants, and savings or debt.‚Äù</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming that you have a monthly income after-tax of $10,000 a month, you allocate $5,000 for Needs, $3,000 for Wants, and $2,000 for Savings or Debt Payment. Just imagine having a $3,000 budget for your Wants. You‚Äôd still get to have fun while on a budget! But this example is only possible if your Needs do not out pace your budget. Usually people‚Äôs Wants are out pacing their budget and nothing is left for savings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the 50/30/20 rule may be an excellent way for some, it will always be dependent on your current financial situation. Some might consider spending less on Wants so that they can have more savings. Some might even forego having a budget allocated for Wants because they want to save more for some future purchases.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also need to consider your location when subscribing to the 50/30/20 Rule Budget. For instance, people who live in areas with a high cost of living may have to put a large part of their income toward housing, making it almost impossible for them to keep their needs under 50% of after-tax pay.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest Savings in ‚ÄúTax-advantaged‚Äù Accounts</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $2,000 monthly savings is already a big start if you‚Äôre applying the 50/30/20 Rule Budget. If you</span><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-be-a-millionaire-453692"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invest as little as $50 a month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in just 54 years, you will have $1 million. But 54 years is a long time!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, an investment of $2,000 a month can make you become a millionaire in 18 years, especially if you invest in ‚Äútax-advantaged‚Äù accounts.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/how-to-invest/2000#the_best_accounts_for_investing_2k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are ‚Äútax-advantaged‚Äù accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?

Not only will your investment grow tax-free, but your state may also offer other tax breaks on contributions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there‚Äôs always the stock market, bonds, real estate, exchange traded funds, or online investment platforms where you can invest your $2k. But take note that investments are speculative. Previous performance results should not be taken as predictors of how these investments will perform in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the point should be re-emphasized that you should invest your savings and get the best rate of return you can get, rather than just keeping the money in a bank account or low-interests bearing savings account.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to or Open a Credit Union Account</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit unions are created, owned, and operated by their participants; they are classified as not-for-profit enterprises that enjoy tax-exempt status. Because of this status, plus the profits they make from the members, credit unions can afford to offer their members higher interest rates on savings accounts and lower interest rates on loans.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just think of how your $2k savings will grow!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit unions are now open to the public. You become a member by opening a savings and/or checking account, apply for loans, and obtain credit cards. Some credit unions also offer investment programs, so you might want to check that out.¬†</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits Of a Credit Union Account¬†</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open a credit union account, you get to</span><a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/benefits-of-a-credit-union"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enjoy the following benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:¬†</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher interest rates on savings</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower fees</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower loan rates</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized customer service</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community focus</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting rights</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous service offerings</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insured deposits</span></li></ul><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher Interest Rates on Savings</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profits earned by credit unions are given back to their members in the form of higher interest rates on savings accounts. Your $2k will yield more interest than when deposited in a for-profit bank.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower Fees</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because credit unions do not have big operating expenses, they tend to have lower fees.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower Loan Rates</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, because of low operating costs, profits are returned to members in the form of lower loan rates. Lower loan rates can save you money on paying interest or give you new sources of funding for running a business or making investments.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15g"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized Customer Service</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of credit unions go the extra mile in helping their members reach financial success. Some even provide financial counseling and training to help members understand complicated financial matters. Making poor financial decisions can make your life miserable and poor. Making better financial decisions can help you save money and have less stress in your life...and that will help you save money and live better.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15h"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Focus</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many credit unions are now open to the public, they tend to attract people with similar interests, living in the same region or area, working in the same organization. You might find a credit union where you can belong and enjoy being a part of an institution that serves the needs of people just like you. Serving your like-minded community can help you feel better about even how you bank.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15i"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you become a credit union member, you also become a co-owner of the credit union. You now have the right to vote on important decisions like selecting the board members, among others.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15j"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous Service Offerings</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit unions‚Äô service offerings are not as extensive as commercial banks. But they have consumer loans, mortgage loans, home loans, car loans, electronic banking, ATMs, business loans, credit cards, and many more.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insured Deposits</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Credit Union Administration, via the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, insures individual deposits of up to $250,000 in federal credit unions (and some state credit unions).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, some credit unions (and many state-chartered ones) are insured privately. Before picking a credit union, you should identify how it‚Äôs insured.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15l"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open a Digital or Online-only Bank Account</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online banks are becoming popular. That‚Äôs because they offer higher interest rates (among other things!). I‚Äôm not talking about your brick-and-mortar retail banks but the digital or¬† online-only banks like American Express, Barclays, and Ally, to mention a few.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like credit unions, online banks can afford higher interest rates because they don‚Äôt have a substantial operating cost. Like retail banks, online banks let you keep your money in a savings or checking account. You also have a selection of checks and debit cards¬† and, of course, online access.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your $2k savings will earn much better in online banks just for the higher interest rates alone. But what are the other</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/11/benefits-and-drawbacks-of-internet-banks.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advantages of having an online-only bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15m"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Interest Rates</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant benefit is the interest you get from online banks. Because online banks do not have a physical structure and overhead costs, they can offer</span><a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/banking/advantages-of-online-banking"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as 70% annual percentage yield (APY)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15n"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low Fees</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before, online banks did not charge fees for transfers, deposits, or account maintenance. They‚Äôre free. Now, they charge fees but still lower than the fees a retail bank may charge you for its services.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Minimum Balance Requirements</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get to keep your money regardless of how much it is, without worrying that the bank will eat up the balance with their fees for account inactivity, account maintenance, and other matterst.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding is Easy</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open an online bank account, you need to satisfy the initial deposit requirement. This can be done by transferring money from an existing account. Or, if the bank is 100% online, you can fund it with a check or a money order.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your online bank has a local branch near you, you can visit it and deposit cash to fund your online bank account.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Check Deposit</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online banks like</span><a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/banking/advantages-of-online-banking"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ally eCheck Deposit and CIT Bank's mobile app offer this service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through their apps. It‚Äôs increasing in popularity and many retail banks have followed suit with their apps.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewards Programs</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online banks offer rewards programs not offered by retail banks outside of their credit cards. Some even allow customers to earn cash rewards on qualifying debit card transactions, while some provide special promo rates for accounts that meet a monthly purchase or balance requirements.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24-hour Customer Service Support</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online banks offer 24/7 support, so you may call them any time you need assistance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not lose focus on your objective to save. The use of an online-only bank is to grow your savings that will yield higher interest rates. The idea here is you should keep the money you deposited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you choose to treat an online-only bank like an ordinary bank, you won‚Äôt be able to save as much as you want to.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virtue (or Power) of Saving</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving is a virtue. A virtue is power. Virtue can also refer to an ethical, desirable trait that also results in advantages and benefits. Nobody ever said that spending was a virtue. Because once you spend money, that money is no longer available for power in other ways.</span></p><p>If you have financial savings, you can also be more <a href="https://homeofficepolitics.com/creativity-business-entrepreneurship-making-money/" title="creative in your business and entrepreneurship as in starting your own business">creative in your business and entrepreneurship as in starting your own business</a>.</p><p>Value/assets can change forms, such as transferring cash into an asset like property or equipment.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you save, you have something to use when the time comes. You also learn how to manage your cash flow to address any financial instability that may come. It also reduces the effect of any financial crisis and helps us be more resilient.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you save, you also learn patience. Another virtue that teaches us that all good things come to those who wait. Imagine waiting for 18 years to see that your $2k savings will become a million.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you‚Äôre wise enough to invest, it might even be greater than that amount. An amount that will allow you to enjoy life. An amount sufficient enough to sustain you through your golden years and live better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So is the Walmart slogan ‚Äúsave money live better‚Äù even possible? The answer is a resounding YES.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options.webp" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/responsive/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/responsive/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/responsive/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/responsive/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/responsive/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/23/responsive/save-money-live-better-saving-frugal-options-2xl.webp 1600w" alt="Saving money and living better by living frugal and loving to save money gives you options." width="960" height="789"><figcaption>Saving money and living better by living frugal and loving to save money gives you options.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mcetoc_1f74ik76c15u"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving Money Gives You Options</span></h2><p>It is worth repeating.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you spend money you are saying yes to that one thing. When you save money, you are saying no to something that might not help you in the long run---and you give yourself an option to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to another thing which can sustain you in the long-term.</span></p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><p>¬†</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on

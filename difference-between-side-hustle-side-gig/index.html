I haven’t! But the way that someone makes money from a side job (hustle or gig) can vary a lot depending on the person.</p><p>Some people like the high-risk and high reward of starting and running their own business, while others like the low-risk and reliability of a second job. No matter what your preference, there is a difference between a side hustle and a side gig.</p><p>Queue the rise of the gig economy, a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts OR freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. And many easy second side jobs that can supplement your income from your day job.</p><p><strong>A side job has two categories: the side hustle and the side gig. Both let you earn extra money, but knowing the difference between the two will help you choose which side job fits you best.</strong></p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Side Hustle vs Side Gig</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a53">The Side Hustle Definition</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a54">The Side Gig Definition</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a55">The Benefits of a Side Hustle</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a56">1.

As a senior bank executive, she can hardly find time to enjoy her passion. When she sold her first script and got noticed for her brilliant work, she started accepting scriptwriting jobs on the side as a side hustle.</p><p>Maddie has not given up her regular job, and continues to write scripts as a side hustle and working for herself in that area. She’s gone on to the big leagues by writing movie scripts too. Now she gets to enjoy her passion and earn from it while still keeping her day job.</p><p>So, a side hustle is:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Self-employed or you work as a contractor</li><li aria-level="1">Usually you still have a primary full-time job</li><li aria-level="1">Paid by the customer directly</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a54">The Side Gig Definition</h2><p>A side gig is another job or work you get paid for doing—but you don’t have to be passionate about it. It’s just another job and you work for and get paid by another employer.</p><p>You just happen to know how to do the work, or can learn how to do the work or have the time to do the work. Most of the time, you are willing to do the side gig (job) because you need the extra cash.</p><p>One great example of a side gig is being a virtual assistant who does a lot of administrative work for a client. Her work is not exactly creative but it is important, e.g. making appointments, scheduling meetings, managing email accounts. Virtual assistants do not have to be passionate about their work, but they do recognize it provides extra cash.</p><p>Another example of a side gig is a laborer. You might get a side job working for a landscaping company to mow lawns or, clean houses, etc. But you work for someone else and get paid by the employer and not the customer.</p><p>So, a side gig is:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Hired by a second employer</li><li aria-level="1">Usually you still have a primary full-time job</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a55">The Benefits of a Side Hustle</h2><p>Mark Twain said, “Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never work a day in your life.” </p><p>While many of us are not fortunate enough to find that dream job,<a href="https://convertkit.com/why-start-a-side-hustle"> side hustling allows us to pursue our passion</a>—on the side and try to earn money.</p><p>More than the extra cash—which is a significant benefit—the personal fulfillment of side hustles gives more meaning and enjoyment at what we do. Remember that personal fulfillment is not something we always <a href="https://senseworldwide.com/are-side-hustles-the-future-of-self-fulfilment/">get from prescribed job titles and office blocks</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of side hustles: </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a56">1. Multiple Sources of Income</h3><p>You can accept side hustle jobs from many clients. They each can become sources of extra cash. For example, what may start out as a passion project like podcasting can become a side hustle that pays more than <a href="https://www.discover.com/online-banking/banking-topics/4-reasons-you-need-a-side-hustle/">$10,000 a month.</a> 🤯</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a57">2. Expand Your Network</h3><p>When you side hustle, you get introduced to---and eventually work with---people who you wouldn’t have the opportunity to work with in your regular day job. You’d be surprised at how word-of-mouth works—referrals that come from unexpected contacts, especially if you did a great job on your side hustle!</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a58">3. Contingency Plan</h3><p>Economic or personal crises throw everyone off, except those who have been doing some side hustles. Check which <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/business-ideas/business-ideas-inspired-by-pandemic">business ideas are emerging out of this crisis</a>. Many of them have to do with health and food delivery.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a59">4. Opportunity to Make Your Side Hustle Full-time</h3><p>Because you’re doing what you love, a<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-started-as-side-hustles-2019-8"> side hustle can lead to something big</a>. For inspiration, here are<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/entrepreneurs-taking-side-hustles-full-time-4136679"> five entrepreneurs who went full-time with their side hustles</a>. Some of them turned their initial writing and design side hustles into high-paying sources of income. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5a">5. Develop Your Entrepreneurial Skills</h3><p>You learn how to manage your resources and time; you become creative in setting up systems and tools your side hustle will need; and, you tap various resources from your network.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5b">6. Expenses Count as Tax Deductions</h3><p>Costs related to operating your own side hustle (side business) can be deducted from revenue and lower your taxable liability. Costs such as computer equipment, home office space, education, materials, etc. can be counted as expenses. Even if you don't have a legal entity in your name, you can still deduct the cost of running your own business in your own name as "unreimbursed business expenses".</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5c"><br>The Benefits of a Side Gig</h2><p>Because side gigs aren’t driven by passion but the necessity to earn extra income, the benefits of a side gig are far more direct—you get paid after doing a one-time job or get paid with each gig you do. However, the standard benefit for both a side hustle and a side gig is that you earn extra cash.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of doing side gigs: </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5d">1.    Multiple Sources of Income</h3><p>If you take on projects that capitalize on your skill set, you can earn from them separately. For example, Andie is a court reporter (sometimes referred to as a stenographer). But she does three gigs online: a typist, a data encoder, and a transcriptionist.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5e">2.    Sharpen Your Skills</h3><p>Side gigs enhance your skill set, giving you many options down the line. One thing is clear, though.<a href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/start-side-gig-hustle-make-money-pros-cons/"> Sharpening your skills can improve your prospects of earning a promotion, bonus, or a raise.</a></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5f">3.    Flexible Schedule</h3><p>Many side gigs provide flexibility in schedule. A lot of them are productivity driven too. So work on your side gigs during your spare time and find out which<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/12/flexjobs-15-of-the-most-common-flexible-side-jobs.html"> common flexible side jobs</a> you might want to consider as a source of extra income.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5g">4.    A Sense of Security.</h3><p>Side gigs give you that sense of financial security just in case you lose your primary source of income. I know of a part-time rideshare driver who was laid off from his office work and went full-time in ridesharing. Of course, this was a calculated move on his part since he’s servicing California and saw a great opportunity.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5h">5.    New Opportunities</h3><p>Side gigs are<a href="https://blog.xolo.io/benefits-of-a-side-gig"> nearly guaranteed to create unforeseen and exciting opportunities</a> that don’t come your way in the confines of an office.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5i">Side Hustle Idea Examples</h2><p>A side hustle isn’t just a money maker. It is a passion, first and foremost. So here are some<a href="https://www.jobacle.com/blog/side-hustle-ideas-that-fit-your-passions.html"> side hustle ideas that might fit your passion</a> which can eventually turn into something profitable in the long run. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5j">1.    Event Planning</h3><p>Everyone loves events but hates planning them. And if planning is your passion, this is where you and your skills come in. The beauty of this side hustle is that it can work on your schedule, especially if you want to just do it on weekends.<br><br>Event planning also pays handsomely, depending on the magnitude of the occasion. The key here is to find the kind of events you want to plan. Many event planners love to do weddings--which usually happens on the weekends. Others love to organize product launches. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5k">2.    Writing</h3><p>If you’re good at writing, you open yourself to many side hustling opportunities like blogging, copywriting, editing, etc. The list goes on. Many businesses engage the services of writers on a per article or a per-project basis, making it a side hustle that’s beneficial for both parties.</p><p>And why not write a book? Many<a href="https://rigorousthemes.com/blog/best-apps-like-wattpad/"> digital platforms encourage writers to come up with stories and get paid for it</a>!</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5l">3.    Cooking/Baking</h3><p>Many people have a passion for cooking. But not all of them are adventurous enough to make a business or side hustle out of it. Side hustle ideas if you love cooking or baking include the following: catering business, selling your goods online,<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/personal-chef-home-business-1794719"> personal chef home business</a>,  etc.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5m">Side Gig Idea Examples</h2><p>Check out some of the<a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/great-side-gigs-part-time-jobs-consider/"> side gig ideas</a> that might fit your interests:</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5n">1.    Ridesharing</h3><p>The go-to gig everyone gets into because it’s a gig you do based on your schedule.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5o">2.    Pet Sitting</h3><p>Perils aside (remember Lady Gaga’s dog sitter?), this is one of the easiest gigs around, especially if you love pets!</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5p">3.    Consulting</h3><p>As a creative marketing guy for decades, I have built my livelihood around marketing and advertising campaign ideation. Various companies have hired me on a consulting basis as their subject matter expert.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5q">There are many consulting opportunities in the following business areas: information technology, software and app development, marketing and sales, customer support, and other business areas.</h3><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5r">The Best Side Hustles</h2><p>The balancesmallbusiness.com came up with a list of the best side hustles for 2021 based on the independent research done by its editors.

Both have tax deductions that can save you some cash. It’s a matter of knowing how to file for it.</li><li>        Always factor in the taxes. Side hustles are income, and taxes apply to all income. So report and file them accordingly.</li><li>        Know the laws. There are many regional laws and unique legal considerations specific to you and your side hustles.</li><li>        Never use your day job’s resources. Aside from being unethical, you are putting your career at risk.</li><li>        Check your contract. Many day jobs prohibit or have some restrictions on side hustles. </li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5t">The Best Side Gigs</h2><p>Do not forget that side gigs are not passion projects. It’s just an easy way to earn extra. Here are some of the best side gig jobs for 2021 according to<a href="https://lifeandabudget.com/top-side-gigs/"> lifeandbudget.com</a>:</p><ul><li>        Freelance writing</li><li>        Freelance proofreading</li><li>        Transcription</li><li>        Becoming a virtual assistant: VAs are very in-demand nowadays.

To reiterate, if you’re skilled at accounting, why not do some bookkeeping gigs?</p><p>Consider the time and effort. Because you have a day job, how much time and effort can you devote to accepting side gigs?  </p><p>Consider the pay vs the effort. Always check if the pay you’re getting from the side gig is commensurate to your effort</p><p>Consider loving the gig itself. While it’s not a passion thing, the gig speaks for your skills as someone who’s capitalizing on it. Do it well, learn to love it, and the gig will love you back with its monetary rewards.</p><p>Consider your passion. While gigs are usually one-offs, why not look out for gigs that will feed your passion? Gigs don’t have to be routine tasks.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a5v">Apps to Help You on Your Gigs or Hustles </h2><p><a href="https://parade.com/979740/megangrant/side-hustle-apps/">Parade</a> lists 25 side job apps that can help you get the best side gigs and best side hustles and earn on the side.

For a comprehensive rundown, check<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-start-a-side-business-while-keeping-your-day-job-4115403"> the balancesmall business</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a61">1.    Prepare For The Long Haul</h3><p>As mentioned a lot of times in this article, a side hustle has something to do with your passion. There are sacrifices to make, systems, and routines to develop and implement for your passion project to succeed. If you’re willing to do this, then you’re on your way to having a successful side hustling business.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a62">2.    Identify Your Skills</h3><p>A great example of monetizing one’s skills is that of Mark, a professional musician I know. He offers piano lessons online. He’s got a regular conducting job during weekends.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a63">3.    Validate Your Side Hustle With a Paying Client</h3><p>Annette used to work in a big telco as a corporate marketing executive. But she managed to snag a paying client, which she did consulting for during her spare time. Now, she is her own boss in her consulting firm, handling many clients along with that one paying client that validated her skills as a marketing consultant.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8p3cn23a64">4.    Avoid Getting Fired From Your Day Job</h3><p>Need I say more?

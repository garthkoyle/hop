I haven’t! But the way that someone makes money from a side job (hustle or gig) can vary a lot depending on the person.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the rise of the gig economy, a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts </span><strong>OR</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. And many side jobs can supplement your income from your day job.</span></p><p><strong>A side job has two categories: the side hustle and the side gig.

As a senior bank executive, she can hardly find time to enjoy her passion. When she sold her first script and got noticed for her brilliant work, she started accepting scriptwriting jobs on the side as a side hustle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maddie has not given up her regular job, and continues to write scripts as a side hustle and working for herself in that area. She’s gone on to the big leagues by writing movie scripts too. Now she gets to enjoy her passion and earn from it while still keeping her day job.</span></p><p>So, a side hustle is:</p><ul><li>Self-employed or you work as a contractor</li><li>Usually you still have a primary full-time job</li><li>Paid by the customer directly</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5j6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side Gig Definition</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A side gig is another job or work you get paid for doing—but you don’t have to be passionate about it. It’s just another job and you work for and get paid by another employer.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just happen to know how to do the work, or can learn how to do the work or have the time to do the work. Most of the time, you are willing to do the side gig (job) because you need the extra cash.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One great example of a side gig is being a virtual assistant who does a lot of administrative work for a client. Her work is not exactly creative but it is important, e.g. making appointments, scheduling meetings, managing email accounts. Virtual assistants do not have to be passionate about their work, but they do recognize it provides extra cash.</span></p><p>Another example of a side gig is a laborer. You might get a side job working for a landscaping company to mow lawns or, clean houses, etc. But you work for someone else and get paid by the employer and not the customer.</p><p>So, a side gig is:</p><ul><li>Employment by a second employer</li><li>Usually you still have a primary full-time job</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5j7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of a Side Hustle</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Twain said, “Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never work a day in your life.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of us are not fortunate enough to find that dream job,</span><a href="https://convertkit.com/why-start-a-side-hustle"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">side hustling allows us to pursue our passion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—on the side and try to earn money.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than the extra cash—which is a significant benefit—a side hustle is the personal fulfillment of that gives more enjoyment and meaning to enjoy what we do. Remember that personal fulfillment is not something we always </span><a href="https://senseworldwide.com/are-side-hustles-the-future-of-self-fulfilment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get from prescribed job titles and office blocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the benefits of side hustles: </span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5j8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><strong>Multiple Sources of Income</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can accept </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">side hustle jobs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from many clients. They each can become sources of extra cash. For example, what may start out as a passion project like podcasting can become a side hustle that pays more than </span><a href="https://www.discover.com/online-banking/banking-topics/4-reasons-you-need-a-side-hustle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$10,000 a month.</span></a> 🤯</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5j9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. </span><strong>Expand Your Network</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you side hustle, you get introduced to---and eventually work with---people who you wouldn’t have the opportunity to work with in your regular day job. You’d be surprised at how word-of-mouth works—referrals that come from unexpected contacts, especially if you did a great job on your side hustle!</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5ja"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. </span><strong>Contingency Plan</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic or personal crisis throw everyone off, except those who have been doing some side hustles. Check which</span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/business-ideas/business-ideas-inspired-by-pandemic"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">business ideas are emerging out of this crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many of them have to do with health and food delivery.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. </span><strong>Opportunity to Make Your Side Hustle Full-time</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you’re doing what you love, a</span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-started-as-side-hustles-2019-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> side hustle can lead to something big</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For inspiration, here are</span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/entrepreneurs-taking-side-hustles-full-time-4136679"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five entrepreneurs who went full-time with their side hustles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of them turned their initial writing and design side hustles into high-paying sources of income. </span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jc"><strong>5. Develop Your Entrepreneurial Skills</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You learn how to manage your resources and time; you become creative in setting up systems and tools your side hustle will need; and, you tap various resources from your network.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jd"><strong>6. Expenses Count as Tax Deductions</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs related to operating your own side hustle (side business) can be deducted from revenue and lower your taxable liability. Costs such as computer equipment, home office space, education, materials, etc. can be counted as expenses. Even if you don't have a legal entity in your name, you can still deduct the cost of running your own business in your own name as "unreimbursed business expenses".</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5je"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of a Side Gig</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's almost all about the money. Because side gigs aren’t driven by passion but the necessity to earn extra income, the benefits of a side gig are far more direct—you get paid after doing a one-time job or get paid with each gig you do. However, the standard benefit for both a side hustle and a side gig is that you earn extra cash.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the benefits of doing side gigs: </span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><strong>Multiple Sources of Income</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take on projects that capitalize on your skill set, you can earn from them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">separately</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, Andie is a court reporter (sometimes referred to as a stenographer). She also works a weekend shift at the hospital in the food services department.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. </span><strong>Sharpen Your Skills</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side gigs enhance your skill set, giving you many options down the line. One thing is clear, though.</span><a href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/start-side-gig-hustle-make-money-pros-cons/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharpening your skills can improve your prospects of earning a promotion, bonus, or a raise.</span></a></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. </span><strong>Flexible Schedule</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many side gigs provide flexibility in schedule. A lot of them are productivity driven too. So work on your side gigs during your spare time and find out which</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/12/flexjobs-15-of-the-most-common-flexible-side-jobs.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">common flexible side jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you might want to consider as a source of extra income.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5ji"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. </span><strong>A Sense of Security</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side gigs give you that sense of financial security just in case you lose your primary source of income. I know of a part-time rideshare driver who was laid off from his office work and went full-time in ridesharing. Of course, this was a calculated move on his part since he’s servicing communities in California and saw a great opportunity.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span><strong>New Opportunities</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side gigs are</span><a href="https://blog.xolo.io/benefits-of-a-side-gig"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly guaranteed to create unforeseen and exciting opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that don’t come your way in the confines of an office.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side Hustle Ideas</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A side hustle isn’t just a money maker. It is a passion, first and foremost. So here are some</span><a href="https://www.jobacle.com/blog/side-hustle-ideas-that-fit-your-passions.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">side hustle ideas that might fit your passion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which can eventually turn into something profitable in the long run.</span><strong> </strong></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><strong>Consulting</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a creative marketing guy for decades, I have built my livelihood around marketing and advertising campaign ideation. You can say that I am a subject matter expert (SME). Various companies have hired me on a consulting basis as their SME.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many consulting opportunities in the following business areas: information technology, software and app development, marketing and sales, customer support, and other business areas.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. </span><strong>Writing</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re good at writing, you open yourself to many side hustling opportunities like blogging, copywriting, editing, etc. The list goes on. Many businesses engage the services of writers on a per article or a per-project basis, making it a side hustle that’s beneficial for both parties.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why not write a book? Many</span><a href="https://rigorousthemes.com/blog/best-apps-like-wattpad/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">digital platforms encourage writers to come up with stories and get paid for it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Andie (in the example above) is a court reporter but she does four gigs online: a typist, data entry, and a transcriptionist and a content writer. She nearly doubles her income doing her side hustles.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. </span><strong>Cooking/Baking</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have a passion for cooking. But not all of them are adventurous enough to make a business or side hustle out of it. Side hustle ideas if you love cooking or baking include the following: catering business, selling your goods online,</span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/personal-chef-home-business-1794719"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">personal chef home business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  etc.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jo">4. Cleaning</h3><p>Cleaning personal homes, second homes, and office can be a good source of reliable incomes. Search out people and neighborhoods where families have multiple jobs and/or large families.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best Side Gig Ideas</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out some of the</span><a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/great-side-gigs-part-time-jobs-consider/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">side gig ideas</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that might fit your interests:</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.</span> <strong>Ridesharing</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The go-to gig everyone gets into because it’s a gig you do based on your schedule.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.</span> <strong>Pet Sitting</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perils aside (remember Lady Gaga’s dog sitter?), this is one of the easiest gigs around, especially if you love pets!</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5js"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.</span> <strong>Event Planning</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone loves events but hates planning them. That’s where you and your planning skills come in. Event planning pays handsomely, depending on the magnitude of the occasion. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f8j0gime5jt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Side Hustle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balancesmallbusiness.com came up with a list of the best side hustles for 2021 based on the independent research done by its editors.

It’s a matter of knowing how to file for it.</span></li><li><strong>Always factor in the taxes. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side hustles are income, and taxes apply to all income.

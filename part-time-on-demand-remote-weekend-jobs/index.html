Of course, this is why we do it‚Äîeither we are saving up for something, or we are trying to make ends meet. One thing is for sure: weekend jobs give us additional purchasing power and financial security.</li><li aria-level="1">Flexible work schedule. This allows us to be financially productive during weekends. You can accommodate several weekend jobs, depending on your schedule.</li><li aria-level="1">Extra monetary support for stay-at-home parents or the disabled. Weekend jobs, especially now that technology allows remote work, help parents and the disabled earn more.</li><li aria-level="1">Second job that doesn't interfere with the first job's schedule. You can concentrate on doing whatever it is you‚Äôre tasked to do without feeling guilty about it.</li></ul><p>But what types of weekend-only side jobs are there?

Weekends are the perfect schedule for many who choose food delivery as their side job.</li><li aria-level="1">Event Staff: As many special events occur on weekends, this is one side hustle that pays well. Plus, if you‚Äôre working in concert venues or sports arenas, you might get to watch the event!</li><li aria-level="1">Caterer: Catering needs a particular type of server: one with solid customer service and communications skills, food management know-how, and the expertise to create custom menus as required. If you‚Äôre into this type of business, why not accept weekend-only engagements?</li><li aria-level="1">Tour Guide: As cities begin to open up, why not show people around your city‚Äîtake them to famous tourist spots, museums, and other local attractions? Just make sure you know a lot of history and backstories to keep your guests entertained.</li><li aria-level="1">Private Tutor: While online tutoring might be the norm right now, nothing beats personal, one-on-one tutoring. You miss out on a lot of things when doing online tutoring. One of which is feeling and discerning whether your student is having a difficult time understanding the lesson. Online tutoring does not easily capture that. Private, personal tutoring will surely come back with a vengeance.</li><li aria-level="1">Retail Sales: Weekends retail sales go up as many people do their shopping on weekends (of course). Stores look for more workers during this time. One perk of this job is that you might even qualify for an employee discount if you want to buy an item from the shop.</li><li aria-level="1">Restaurant Server: Weekends are always hectic for the restaurant business. Many of them hire extra help to serve their patrons. And of course, as a server, you will also get some tips along the way.</li></ul><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/rideshare-weekend-job-sm.webp" alt="Ridesharing can be a great weekend job that won't compromise your day job." width="960" height="640" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/rideshare-weekend-job-sm-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/rideshare-weekend-job-sm-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/rideshare-weekend-job-sm-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/rideshare-weekend-job-sm-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/rideshare-weekend-job-sm-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/rideshare-weekend-job-sm-2xl.webp 1600w"><figcaption>Ridesharing can be a great weekend job that won't compromise your day job.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mcetoc_1fdd0lpec17">On-demand Weekend Jobs</h2><p>‚ÄúOn-demand‚Äù jobs are jobs that arise when there‚Äôs a business need for it. The definition itself emphasizes the briefness of the opportunity, which makes it ideal for treating it as a side job.</p><p>‚ÄúThe nature of on-demand jobs is that you work only when you have the time and desire to work,‚Äù as<a href="https://www.wayup.com/s/part-time-jobs/on-demand/"> WayUp.com</a> pointed out. ‚ÄúGiven the rigorous schedules of students, these flexible hours work in their favor.

Some companies require a bike for uncomplicated deliveries (a bag of groceries, a bouquet of flowers, etc.) or sometimes a bigger car (laundry delivery, packages, etc.). Deliveries can come in various shapes and sizes; just make sure your vehicle can accommodate delivery jobs.</li><li aria-level="1">Rideshare - We're all familiar with Lyft and Uber. Here‚Äôs a<a href="https://financebuzz.com/best-rideshare-markets-study"> list of markets for ridesharing</a> which you can check out during weekends. Ridesharing has become the go-to side job of many weekend jobbers because you only do it in your spare time. And now, you have the weekends to do it.</li></ul><p>Labor - These jobs have two classifications: Personal and Business Jobs. You may find lots of consumers and businesses that need work done on the weekends and not the weekdays. These can include cleaning buildings, landscaping, or trade workers like plumbers or electricians who might have to work when a business is closed so they don‚Äôt interrupt the business during the week.</p><p>Under On-demand Personal Jobs are tasks done by handymen, cleaners and housekeepers, movers, caregivers, pet sitters, house sitters, and more. These jobs may involve lots of manual work, which can be light or heavy, depending on the work you‚Äôre contracted to do.¬†</p><p>On-demand Business Jobs involve work for businesses. One great example of this is warehouse operations, where many activities are happening, such as stocking and assembly. Warehouses, especially of retail products, every so often need additional help to meet increased demands‚Äîthink of Black Friday, or the Christmas season.</p><p>Other On-demand Business Jobs are event staffing, general labor, retail merchandise, contact centers, and more.</p><p>Skilled and Professional - These are jobs dependent on your skills. Writing, cooking, web design and development, teaching and coaching, legal advice, accounting work, and more. Note that the tasks mentioned have a lot to do with a profession and the skills needed to perform it.</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/remote-work-weekend-job.webp" alt="Earn extra income with a remote job that won't compromise your day job." width="960" height="580" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/remote-work-weekend-job-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/remote-work-weekend-job-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/remote-work-weekend-job-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/remote-work-weekend-job-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/remote-work-weekend-job-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/35/responsive/remote-work-weekend-job-2xl.webp 1600w"><figcaption>Earn extra income with a remote job that won't compromise your day job.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mcetoc_1fdd0lpec19">Remote Weekend Work</h2><p>For a freelancer (or someone who does many side jobs), remote work is very familiar.

It is based on the concept that work does not need to be done in a specific place to be executed successfully.‚Äù</p><p>As a professional who has a 9-to-5 day job, you can accept side jobs by doing remote work on weekends.</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><p id="mcetoc_1fdd0lpec1a"><strong>Some Weekend Remote Work You Can Do:</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Creative Work: Writing, blogging, designing, layout, web designing, and more.

That means ridesharing and delivery services, online products selling, running errands, and the like are subject to federal income tax.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-pay-taxes-on-side-jobs-income-irs">Business Insider article</a> on how to pay taxes if you‚Äôre doing side jobs reminds us that freelancers still have to file and pay for their federal income taxes. Just make sure you keep a record of what side jobs you‚Äôve worked on and how much you were paid. Self-employment means a 15.3% tax on income above $400.</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fdd0lpec1c">Concluding Your Weekend with a Job</h2><p>One of the best ways to supplement your regular income is by having a weekend-only side job. This way, you can concentrate on your regular Monday to Friday 9-to-5 work without the trappings of a side job after 5 PM.</p><p>Weekend-only jobs also spare you from the stress of juggling two jobs simultaneously: your day job and your side job. Sooner or later, it will take a toll on your health and your day job.</p><p>Many people I know have opted to take on weekend side gigs which can be less stressful than the 9-5 job. Weekend-only jobs do not take much of their time away from the family while giving the freelancer more ‚Äòme time‚Äô too.

But long-distance deliveries are not popular with delivery drivers (or Dashers as they are called).</p><p>One dasher, Jerry, detailed <a href="https://www.kindafrugal.com/how-is-driving-for-doordash/">his experience with DoorDash </a>in his blog, saying that he ‚Äúloves side hustling‚Äú and that¬† trying out DoorDash came naturally.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúI need a side hustle I can do according to my schedule quirks. When I have free time, ideally I would use it to make extra money...With DoorDash, you can accept deliveries any time as long as restaurants are open. You can work as much or as little as you want.

Most of the apps allow you to set your rates per hour or per project. Some apps will ask you to bid for a project.</p><p>You have to pay close attention to how you get paid and when, because some apps will charge you a service fee for getting you signed up for a gig. Then there are instances where you only get paid when the project is finished.</p><p>As always, make sure to take note of all your income for tax-filing purposes.</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fdq4su6k1li">Exercise Caution</h2><p>When looking for side gigs on these apps, don‚Äôt throw caution to the wind. <a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/Avoid-Work-from-Home-Job-Scams">Monster</a> reminds us that the popularity of online jobs has also resulted in frauds who resort to the following to get your money:¬† claims processing, envelope stuffing, refund-recovery work, and wire transfer schemes, among others.¬†¬†</p><p>The site even shares tips how to identify fraudulent jobs online:</p><ol><li aria-level="1">If a job posting uses Gmail as their email</li><li aria-level="1">If the only interview is done by online chat</li><li aria-level="1">If the job description sounds too good to be true</li><li aria-level="1">If the potential employer does not care much about your qualifications for the position</li><li aria-level="1">If a job requires you to pay a fee to get the job</li><li aria-level="1">If the job says they overpaid you and that you need to send them a check.</li></ol><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fdq4su6k1lj">My Experiences</h2><p>If you‚Äôre not sure about signing up with a job app, you can do your research and seek people who have been doing side gigs through various apps.</p><p>For example, take my case; I still use Upwork for some side hustles whenever there‚Äôs a need for me to raise funds for a much-needed vacation. Upwork is my go-to side gig app because I feel safe dealing with clients who want to engage my services as a writer. But then, there‚Äôs that fee that Upwork gets from my earnings. So what I do is factor in that Upwork fee into my rate, which I propose to my client.</p><p>My experience with Indeed is terrific. I signed up with them because of the multitude of opportunities they have for a writer like me. I have set up job alerts that give me a list of writing opportunities to choose which employer I will send my resume to. Their user interface on my mobile phone is very user-friendly, too.</p><p>And yes, I got some projects from Indeed. That‚Äôs how I am happy with them.</p><p>But don‚Äôt have to take my word for it. It would be best if you experience using these apps to appreciate their functionalities fully.</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p></div><aside

Living in New York City can be expensive from taxi fares to simple food and housing costs. That‚Äôs why, when in the Big Apple, a high paying job, a second job, or a side hustle or side gig, is a must-have.¬†</p><p>Placed just off the coast of the Northern Atlantic Ocean, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/">New York </a>is often considered cold in the winter and pleasant in the summer. The pillars of its economy are mostly real estate, health care, financial services, and new technology.¬†</p><p>Because there are almost 20 million people living in NYC, it stands to reason that there would be a huge demand for medical services. Another large market is real estate; with so many people in the city, housing continues to be built, sold, and rented at alarming costs. Not only are housing and medicine in high demand but also manufacturing. This may sound strange at first but New York is one of the U.S.‚Äôs major exporting locations of manufactured goods as well as popular clothing lines, glass, and other things like computers and mobile devices.¬†</p><p>New York City is also the main source of journalism, new media, and news throughout the United States. So without further ado, here are some great and well-paying weekend jobs that can be found right in New York City.¬†</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Weekend Jobs in New York City</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbo">Health Care</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbp">Pet Sitter</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbq">Weekend Maid</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbr">Babysitter</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbs">Real Estate Agent</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbt">Housekeeper</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbu">NYC Matchmaker</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1fecgg11dbv">Retail Sales Associate</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="mcetoc_1fecgg11dbo">Health Care</h2><p>One option is to work as a CNA, which stands for certified nursing assistant. In this position you would need to have a heart that can care for everyone you‚Äôre asked to watch over, and then help them with their daily activities like getting dressed, eating, and general hygiene. While this job can be a nitty-gritty one, it can also be very rewarding.¬†</p><p>As a CNA, you would be asked to take care of residents or patients in a hospital setting and assist them with their ADL‚Äôs (activities of daily living) which would include but are not limited to dressing, eating, grooming, general hygiene, and getting around. You would also be required to clean up messes that nurses and doctors are too busy to take care of, and comfort patients and family members in times of difficult news or hard days.¬†</p><p>To fulfill a CNA position, you must have a caring heart that can sympathize with those who are going through challenging circumstances with their health or overall satisfaction in life. You must have patience to deal with problems that older patients may exhibit, i.e. forgetting things, trouble in speaking, or difficulty going to the bathroom alone. You would be required by your employer to have a CNA certification along with a CPR certification in case of emergency.¬†</p><p>Some New York employers to look into are Floral Long Term Care facility, a residential care facility that takes care of those who can no longer take care of themselves. They take pride in the small community they‚Äôre able to create within the care home and present a warm and welcoming front. Another place to consider is <a href="https://www.cobblehilllifecare.org/cobblehill/">Cobble Hill Nursing Home </a>which is located in Brooklyn. It is a great place to work as the environment is a friendly and open space, and those working there strive for both independence and team effort.¬†</p><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fecgg11dbp">Pet Sitter</h2><p>We all know that the stereotypical New Yorker has a dog that he or she will bring to Central Park to play fetch or mingle with other furry creatures. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a tried and true job-hunting fact that most New Yorkers need pet sitters on the weekend when they go out to play on their own.¬†</p><p>As a pet sitter, you would be asked to pick up after the pet, cleaning up any messes they make, feeding them at the correct times, getting their energy out by taking them on walks or playing with them, and then reporting back to their owners how they did. If the pet suffered an accident, damaged someone‚Äôs property, or showed signs of sickness, then you have to report that, too.</p><p>To be a pet sitter means that you must be responsible. You‚Äôre no longer simply taking care of yourself, you‚Äôre also taking care of another person‚Äôs pet. You must also be punctual and able to handle high-strung pets that may give you trouble at times, because they bite on their leash or make a run for it up the nearest tree. You should also have a friendly demeanor that will make it possible for you to get along well with the pets and not be afraid of them.¬†</p><p>This type of pet sitting job could make you anywhere from $25 to $30 a day with shifts anywhere from 8-12 hours. The shifts will include either early mornings, late nights, or both. To be a pet sitter requires commitment to both the owner and the pet. To find a sitter job for pets, you can look on boards at your local animal shelter or pound as well as flyers posted on poles and around the city, and as always, you can look on job searching websites such as New York City Job Boards, Snagajob, and CareerCloud, all widely used websites in New York to find a pet sitting job.¬†</p><p>Employers like <a href="http://www.mixypaws.com/">MixyPaws NYC Dog Walking,</a> which has a 4.8 star review on Google, offers onsite training, walking, playmates, and any other amenities a dog owner may come in need of. Another great place to work in New York is Buddy‚Äôs Dog Den, with two locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan. This amazing doggy daycare offers monitored overnight sleepovers, grooming, feeding, and playing with the dogs trusted to their care.¬†</p><p>If you‚Äôre an animal lover in the Big Apple, this weekend job near New York City is the perfect one for you. You can classify it under the ‚Äúplaces to work near me.‚Äù</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide.webp" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/responsive/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/responsive/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/responsive/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/responsive/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/responsive/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/40/responsive/new-york-city-weekend-job-maide-2xl.webp 1600w" alt="" width="960" height="652"><figcaption>Babysitter Weekend Job in New York City</figcaption></figure><p class="align-right">‚òùüèΩ back to <a href="http://#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fecgg11dbq">Weekend Maid</h2><p>Okay, so perhaps this may be one of the more boring jobs but if you like to clean and organize, being a weekend maid is the way to go in NYC.

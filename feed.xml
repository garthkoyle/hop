    We've been working online since 2002. We begun doing technical support and design services for an early ecommerce platform. Our first full-time work from home gig started in 2011 and we've been doing this ever since. We now manage five brands with a few dozen contractors.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've always thought we should chronicle our lives and experience working from home. We've had challenges, fun times, and love the puns all along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Follow us and we'll introduce you to how you can work from home on your own side hustle, time gig working for someone else, and save money too.

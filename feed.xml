                    You have heard the horror stories of the “starving artist” who just wants to pursue their passion but can’t afford to pay their rent, much less support his family. How does an artistic, creative person like you make sure you won’t go hungry pursuing your passion? How can you have fun learning, creating, and expressing yourself while also earning a living? If you are asking questions like these, you do have a valid and meaningful concern. While it’s true that a degree per-se does not qualify one for such jobs as much as hard smart work afterward does, earring the right degree or getting the right education does give you an early head start. There is power and money making opportunities with creative and artistic thinking. Education and training is like getting compounding interest on your money that continues to build and grow and pay you throughout your entire life. (share with the world) We took the time to research the most and high-paying artistic creative jobs, the creative majors, creative educations, and creative degrees that are behind the best creative and artistic jobs. Knowing your desired destination and each respective starting point, can lead to making reliable and realistic&hellip;

                    I have been in the business of creative communications for more than 30 years. I started as an ad copywriter and now wear many different creative hats: I became an account manager, a layout artist, a creative director, a media planner, and a marketing communications consultant. I have learned how being more creative can lead to more opportunities to make money. So, whenever there’s an opportunity to improve my creativity and learn from new experiences, count me in. You might say that I am a creative person, and creative thinking comes naturally to me. But is creativity confined to people like me? What about people who don't consider themselves "creative" or artists? Can’t they be creative too? This is not an idle question that just stops at self-reflection. We (you and me) need to understand our creative gifts and the way that the creative process works, because improved creative thinking can lead us to making more money. (share with the world) There are real opportunities for creative people, especially professionals who have creative majors or degrees or education to make money.

                     We've been working online since 2002. We begun doing technical support and design services for an early ecommerce platform. Our first full-time work from home gig started in 2011 and we've been doing this ever since. We now manage five brands with a few dozen contractors. We've always thought we should chronicle our lives and experience working from home. We've had challenges, fun times, and love the puns all along the way. Follow us and we'll introduce you to how you can work from home on your own side hustle, time gig working for someone else, and save money too.

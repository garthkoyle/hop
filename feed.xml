                    Teens are getting to an age where they want to start making money. They often find more interest doing chores around the house for extra money, or doing odd jobs for family members. If you are interested in making money as a teen, here is some advice and a good list on where to get started. As your teenagers get older, we have 100 creative ways to make money. Official money-making for teens can begin at 12 years old, within legal boundaries. The younger the child is, the more likely they can only work for family members (parents). Federal law mandates 14 &amp; 15 year olds cannot work more than 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week, and not more than 3 hours a day or 18 hours a week on school days. If it's hard for teens to get time off during the weekday, then an easy weekend job might work better for their schedule. Restrictions for teens working are lifted once a teen turns 16. Nevertheless, minors (younger than 18) are not allowed to work before 7 a.m. nor after 7 p.m. Most of the jobs for teens pay around $10 per hour. Teens that are&hellip;

Beyond just shopping at Walmart, we will show you why and how you can save more money and also live a better. Saving money can be a source of happiness, not just security---because it will give you more money for other things you value. When you save money you also give yourself options. Options that can be a safety net or opportunities for investments in the future. Let’s take another look at the benefits and strategies of how to save money and live better. When financially challenging or uncertain times happen in our lives, these challenges present a good opportunity for us to save money and encourage us to look at creative ways to make more money.

                    More and more people like you are looking for creative ways to make money. Gallup Great Jobs Survey in 2019 stated that 33% of the respondents work more than just one job for financial reasons; apparently one job is not enough to pay the bills or enough to help them reach their financial goals. What’s interesting is that a large portion of the respondents (48%) said that their reason for having a second job (a side gig) or starting their own business (a side hustle) is simply preference: they just do not want to rely on one source of income, period. To date, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about 9.7 million Americans who have lost their jobs---and are looking for work. At the time of this publishing, that means that the unemployment rate in the United States stands at 6.0%. While the government is cautiously optimistic that this will go down to about 5% by the end of 2021, no one serious about their future and the welfare of their family will just wait for the good times to roll back in. Millennials and Gen-Z workers are experiencing difficult times finding work and satisfying work.

                    Whether you have some time to kill or you want to earn some extra money, there are a lot of easy weekend jobs you can choose from. Weekend jobs can be hard to find until you know the right places to look. Some require more hours than others but all of them are worth the extra time and money you get in the end if you choose something you love. The following weekend jobs are easy because they have few requirements and deal more with common sense rather than trained skills or pure talent. These jobs are always available in any community and many even pay well above minimum wage if you find the right one. Weekend jobs are often ones that require you to spend more hours on them simply because you’ll need to catch up on the weeks worth of work, but they’re a great side gig because you’ll have the time to complete them efficiently and these weekend only jobs are often done best over the weekend. But why choose to spend them doing something you can’t have fun with? After all, you are sacrificing your weekend. So, here is a list of different but interesting weekend&hellip;

                    Creativity is most often associated with artists such as painters, fashion designers, pottery makers, or generally people who like to make things. When “creativity” and “making money” are combined, someone usually thinks of artistic industries like selling artwork, advertising, selling artwork in museums, and possibly media or entertainment such as movies or television. However, creativity or business creativity is not limited to any business, industry, or person. Creativity can be found in any business, organization, project, and even hobby. The more creative you get the more successful you're likely to be. As an example, business creativity is like thinking of other ways to use math and arrive at the number 2. While most people would immediately say 1+1=2, creative problem solvers would be more thorough and answer 0+2, 4-2, 1*2, 2*1, 3-1, etc. to get to 2. Creative problem solvers know that there is more than one way to get to an answer. Being creative actually allows you to solve problems in new or novel ways. Creative thinking is one of the reasons why entrepreneurship is becoming so popular. With the number of gaps between problems and solutions in the world, entrepreneurs are seeing opportunities and can often move at&hellip;

                    You have heard the horror stories of the “starving artist” who just wants to pursue their passion but can’t afford to pay their rent, much less support his family. How does an artistic, creative person like you make sure you won’t go hungry pursuing your passion? How can you have fun learning, creating, and expressing yourself while also earning a living? If you are asking questions like these, you do have a valid and meaningful concern. While it’s true that a degree per-se does not qualify one for such jobs as much as hard smart work afterward does, earring the right degree or getting the right education does give you an early head start. There is power and money making opportunities with creative and artistic thinking. Education and training is like getting compounding interest on your money that continues to build and grow and pay you throughout your entire life. (share with the world) We took the time to research the most and high-paying artistic creative jobs, the creative majors, creative educations, and creative degrees that are behind the best creative and artistic jobs.

                    I have been in the business of creative communications for more than 30 years. I started as an ad copywriter and now wear many different creative hats: I became an account manager, a layout artist, a creative director, a media planner, and a marketing communications consultant. I have learned how being more creative can lead to more opportunities to make money. So, whenever there’s an opportunity to improve my creativity and learn from new experiences, count me in. You might say that I am a creative person, and creative thinking comes naturally to me. But is creativity confined to people like me? What about people who don't consider themselves "creative" or artists? Can’t they be creative too? This is not an idle question that just stops at self-reflection. We (you and me) need to understand our creative gifts and the way that the creative process works, because improved creative thinking can lead us to making more money. (share with the world) There are real opportunities for creative people, especially professionals who have creative majors or degrees or education to make money. Many people think that creativity is something you have or you don’t. Thinking that only a certain people are&hellip;

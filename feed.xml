                     We've been working online since 2002. We begun doing technical support and design services for an early ecommerce platform. Our first full-time work from home gig started in 2011 and we've been doing this ever since. We now manage five brands with a few dozen contractors. We've always thought we should chronicle our lives and experience working from home. We've had challenges, fun times, and love the puns all along the way. Follow us and we'll introduce you to how you can work from home on your own side hustle, time gig working for someone else, and save money too.

            "summary": "Walmart’s slogan---“save money live better”---is popular and catchy, but is it really possible to actually save money and live better? Beyond just shopping at Walmart, we will show you why and how you can save more money and also live a better. Saving money can be a source of happiness, not just security---because it will give you more money for other things you value. When you save money you also give yourself options. Options that can be a safety net or opportunities for investments in the future. Let’s take another look at the benefits and strategies of how to save money and live better. When financially challenging or uncertain times happen in our lives, these challenges present a good opportunity for us to save money. Saving money gives us options. If we lose a job or an important client, or face a major medical emergency, we will have hoped we were judicious in our spending. If we have a little savings we can be choosy about how we spend or invest that money. According to CNBC, nearly 40% of people said they’re shopping online every week, during a pandemic. Retailers are also reporting record online sales. But what items were&hellip;",

            "summary": "More and more people like you are looking for creative ways to make money. Gallup Great Jobs Survey in 2019 stated that 33% of the respondents work more than just one job for financial reasons; apparently one job is not enough to pay the bills or enough to help them reach their financial goals. What’s interesting is that a large portion of the respondents (48%) said that their reason for having a second job (a side gig) or starting their own business (a side hustle) is simply preference: they just do not want to rely on one source of income, period. To date, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about 9.7 million Americans who have lost their jobs---and are looking for work. At the time of this publishing, that means that the unemployment rate in the United States stands at 6.0%. While the government is cautiously optimistic that this will go down to about 5% by the end of 2021, no one serious about their future and the welfare of their family will just wait for the good times to roll back in. Millennials and Gen-Z workers are experiencing difficult times finding work and satisfying work.",

Weekend jobs can be hard to find until you know the right places to look. Some require more hours than others but all of them are worth the extra time and money you get in the end if you choose something you love. The following weekend jobs are easy because they have few requirements and deal more with common sense rather than trained skills or pure talent. These jobs are always available in any community and many even pay well above minimum wage if you find the right one. Weekend jobs are often ones that require you to spend more hours on them simply because you’ll need to catch up on the weeks worth of work, but they’re a great side gig because you’ll have the time to complete them efficiently and these weekend only jobs are often done best over the weekend. But why choose to spend them doing something you can’t have fun with? After all, you are sacrificing your weekend. So, here is a list of different but interesting weekend&hellip;",

            "summary": "Creativity is most often associated with artists such as painters, fashion designers, pottery makers, or generally people who like to make things. When “creativity” and “making money” are combined, someone usually thinks of artistic industries like selling artwork, advertising, selling artwork in museums, and possibly media or entertainment such as movies or television. However, creativity or business creativity is not limited to any business, industry, or person. Creativity can be found in any business, organization, project, and even hobby. The more creative you get the more successful you're likely to be. As an example, business creativity is like thinking of other ways to use math and arrive at the number 2. While most people would immediately say 1+1=2, creative problem solvers would be more thorough and answer 0+2, 4-2, 1*2, 2*1, 3-1, etc. to get to 2. Creative problem solvers know that there is more than one way to get to an answer. Being creative actually allows you to solve problems in new or novel ways. Creative thinking is one of the reasons why entrepreneurship is becoming so popular. With the number of gaps between problems and solutions in the world, entrepreneurs are seeing opportunities and can often move at&hellip;",

How does an artistic, creative person like you make sure you won’t go hungry pursuing your passion? How can you have fun learning, creating, and expressing yourself while also earning a living? If you are asking questions like these, you do have a valid and meaningful concern. While it’s true that a degree per-se does not qualify one for such jobs as much as hard smart work afterward does, earring the right degree or getting the right education does give you an early head start. There is power and money making opportunities with creative and artistic thinking. Education and training is like getting compounding interest on your money that continues to build and grow and pay you throughout your entire life.

You might say that I am a creative person, and creative thinking comes naturally to me. But is creativity confined to people like me? What about people who don't consider themselves \"creative\" or artists? Can’t they be creative too? This is not an idle question that just stops at self-reflection. We (you and me) need to understand our creative gifts and the way that the creative process works, because improved creative thinking can lead us to making more money.

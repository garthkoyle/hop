Weekend jobs can be hard to find until you know the right places to look. Some require more hours than others but all of them are worth the extra time and money you get in the end if you choose something you love. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following weekend jobs are easy because they have few requirements and deal more with common sense rather than trained skills or pure talent. These jobs are always available in any community and many even pay well above minimum wage if you find the right one. Weekend jobs are often ones that require you to spend more hours on them simply because you’ll need to catch up on the weeks worth of work, but they’re a great side gig because you’ll have the time to complete them efficiently and these weekend only jobs are often done best over the weekend. </span></p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Low Skill, High Availability = Easy Weekend Jobs</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4og">Healthcare</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oh">Caregiver</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oi">Donating Plasma</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oj">Hospital Janitor</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ok">Hospital Kitchen Server</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ol">Dispatcher</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4om">Retail</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4on">Receptionist</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oo">Sign Spinner</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4op">Influencer Marketing</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oq">Caretaking</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4or">Nanny</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4os">House Sitter</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ot">House Cleaner</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ou">Pet Sitter</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ov">Driving</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p0">Taxi Driver</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p1">Delivery Driver</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p2">Runaround Driver</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p3">Shuttle Driver</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p4">Creative Jobs</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p5">Blog Writer</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p6">Wedding/Family Photographer</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p7">Product Builder</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p8">Calligraphy Card Designer</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p9">Start Exploring those Weekend Jobs</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why choose to spend them doing something you can’t have fun with? After all, you are sacrificing your weekend. So, here is a list of different but interesting weekend jobs you can do with your time off that you’ll find you can actually enjoy or could help you with your future career.</span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4og"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are always weekend jobs available for health care workers or in the healthcare field. You can help take care of people and patients, clean medical facilities, or donate blood or plasma, etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advantage to healthcare-related jobs is that you get to work in a field that is always in demand. As long as you are reliable and honest, you could have a job in the healthcare field. With a health care job, you also get to work with smart and well-qualified people like nurse assistants, nurses, doctores, etc. You also get to directly help to improve people’s lives. Healthcare jobs often give you opportunities to demonstrate your skills and reliability and we have seen people progress from entry-level jobs to be high-level executives over the course of years or decades.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are good weekend jobs because the healthcare facility will need workers every hour of every day of the week. You will likely be taking over after someone else finishes their regular shift during the week or after regular business hours. So these are easy night and weekend jobs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best easy weekend jobs in healthcare.</span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caregiver</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An entry-level caregiver will work in a small family home or facility where you would take care of children, disabled, or elderly persons. Caregivers may help feed, cloth, and entertain patients. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50.webp" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/raychan-yk7F8bdD0eU-unsplash-50-2xl.webp 1600w" alt="Caregiving can be an easy weekend job." width="436" height="460"><figcaption>Caregiving can be an easy weekend job.</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the requirements for this job are that you aren’t squeamish around natural bodily functions such as feeding a child or helping an elderly person go to the bathroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CNA certification could be preferred but not always required . You must have a warm heart capable of taking care of people who can no longer do that for themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compensation for this job is going to be around $10 to $15 an hour for eight hour shifts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many facilities will have a help wanted sign posted on their building or jobs posted on their website if they need more caregivers.</span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donating Plasma</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donating plasma  is perfect for a weekend job because it does not require the typical 9-5 hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To donate plasma,  a nurse will measure and test your plasma. If you are healthy and able, you’ll move on to the actual donation portion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will sit in a chair, a tech will place a needle in your arm, and a machine will draw blood from you, separate the plasma, and return your blood. The donation process is usually done within 2 hours for your first appointment and 1 hour for every following one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, something to note is that donating plasma can be a little bit tricky. You have to be well hydrated as your plasma is made almost entirely out of water. The technicians prefer that you eat something high in protein and low in fats at most 2 hours before donating. Getting a good night's rest and avoiding smoking 30 minutes before your appointment are also great ways to ensure you can donate. They’ll test both your veins, if one or both are not big enough, sadly they will have to reject you for plasma donation. But the chances of that are rare occurrences.Focus on taking care of yourself and you should be a great candidate for donation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average visit to a plasma donation center will have you walking away with anywhere from $20 to $50. You can schedule an appointment with a plasma center by searching “Plasma Centers Near Me”. Your plasma needs to replenish itself which takes around 48 hours so the maximum number of times you can donate in a week is 2, and in a month 8. If you aren’t sick at the sight of needles, this could be a great weekend job that pays really well! </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospital Janitor</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hospital janitor job would typically make sure all bathrooms, patient rooms, and hallways are clear and clean as well as report any malfunction of equipment to the correct authorities. Some janitors even perform light groundskeeping work like shoveling snow, mowing the lawn, and watering trees and plants.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This job would take place in a facility or hospital and only asks for a high school diploma or GED certification but is not necessarily required. A background in shop is certainly helpful when considering applications but again does not determine whether you can apply or not. Good communication skills, time management, and attention to detail are all qualities of a good janitor. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pay to be a hospital janitor can be between $10 and $15. You would typically find job postings on hiring websites like Indeed.com or ZipRecruiter and your local healthcare facility’s website. If you find that you want to work in healthcare a little but have had no previous experience, this could be the best opportunity to make a difference. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ok"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospital Kitchen Server</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a hospital kitchen server, you would prepare the food trays for the patients, following any dietary requirements they have during their hospital stay.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is preferred that you have a high school diploma or GED certificate, you must be able to lift up to 40 lbs, and this job requires a lot of standing and walking. To be successful, you should have a cheerful demeanor and good communication skills so you can talk to the patients and visiting family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average pay for this job is around $10 an hour. Again, to find this type of job, Indeed.com or any other job listing website would certainly have means to contact an employer directly. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4ol"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatcher</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dispatcher in a hospital helps facilitate communication among the health care workers in the facility. You will help communicate when hospital rooms are available, when patients need to be transferred, communicate the need for hospital rooms, etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This job would require you to be in a strong emotional state as you would be dealing with people in life crises and other health care workers will contact you often asking for help. A healthcare dispatcher can be a really gratifying job that will bring you good memories of helping those in need. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only specific requirement for this job is that you have a high school diploma or GED. The payment for this job, on average, is around $14 an hour and could be a great weekend job for those of you who want to make a difference in healthcare.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way to get hired for this job would be to search on Indeed.com or if you have any personal connections to fire department or law enforcement personnel, they may know of job opportunities for you. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4om"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To work in retail is one of the most admirable jobs as you will be working with customers' complaints and compliments. Retail requires that you know how to sell products for your company and recall information about them. You must also have a calm demeanor able to handle upset customers with professionalism and class. When needed you may be asked to help stock and receive inventory or any other odd jobs retail requires. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/retail-easy-weekend-jobs.webp" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/retail-easy-weekend-jobs-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/retail-easy-weekend-jobs-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/retail-easy-weekend-jobs-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/retail-easy-weekend-jobs-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/retail-easy-weekend-jobs-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/retail-easy-weekend-jobs-2xl.webp 1600w" alt="Retail jobs are easy weekend job because they have low requirements and high availability." width="940" height="705"><figcaption>Retail jobs are easy weekend job because they have low requirements and high availability.</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers are almost always hiring people to stock shelves, be a cashier, watch the self-checkout line, clean the building, return carts, answer phones, hold signs, welcome people to the store, etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail doesn’t always pay the best because the jobs are so easy to qualify for, but they are very common. Once you have experience in a retail job you can use that experience at another retailer for any weekend retail job.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you have had a lot of experience, working in retail can be one of those ‘easy money weekend jobs’ that you can do when you need cash ASAP.</span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4on"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receptionist</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a receptionist you would make appointments, help customers with scheduling and billing questions, and receive the payments from customers. This job requires basic computer skills along with knowing how to schedule and communicate with people in a way that they can easily understand you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This job is great for anyone who knows their way around a computer and has great people skills. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay for this position in a company can be in the range of $10 to $19. If you know anyone who recently opened an office or have seen signs for a new office around town, drop by and see if they have any positions open for a receptionist. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Spinner</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you love to move your hands or you want to remember your old baton twirling days, being a sign spinner can be an easy weekend job. Go to a place you trust, a place you would endorse yourself to apply to be a sign spinner. This job would require long hours outside so water and a hat are essentials in this line of work.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have a lot of energy, this job pays about $15 an hour and could be exactly what you need to be more active outside. Be on the lookout for “Help Wanted” signs and other sign spinners around town. If they have one sign spinner, they could be in need of more sign spinners on the weekend or to take another shift. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4op"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer Marketing</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing could be the easiest weekend job you’ll find on this list. These people are paid by a company to promote and endorse their products. You try the products and if you like them, you spread the word about their product.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50.webp" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/influencer-marketing-easy-weekend-job-50-2xl.webp 1600w" alt="Influencer marketing can be an easy weekend job." width="940" height="529"><figcaption>Influencer marketing can be an easy weekend job.</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencers can be paid as much as $250 per post,  making influencer marketing one of the weekend jobs that pay well. However, you need to have a decent amount of followers to qualify as an influencer. Influencing can be a great weekend job that racks in the money just for trying and talking about a product on social media. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find an easy weekend job as a social media influencer would be to browse any social media and look for other influencers. They’ll often mention what they do and post when their company wants more influencers on their side. You can also look at what brands other influencers are promoting and contact the brand to offer your services.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also influencer platforms that connect brands to influences. You can apply to be part of their influencer programs.</span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4oq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caretaking</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caretaking jobs require more hours than most because you need to watch children or pets who have high energy and an almost non-existent fear of dangerous things. Careful attention must be paid during a caretaking job to ensure that those under your watch are protected and given everything to meet their basic needs of life. Caretaking is one many admire but few have the time to do, even as parents. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caretaking can be a fun and energetic job, especially if you look after small children. Their energy is unmatched and the things they say will have you laughing for days. Forming a bond with the kids you look after is an essential part of this job. It makes taking them to activities easier, discipline smoother, and loving them all the more meaningful. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking good care of a house you’re asked to watch is important as well. Keeping packages from being stolen or rained on is deeply appreciated by homeowners, along with tidying up any messes made and protecting their house by locking up when you leave for the night. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to note of caretaking is that it can require long hours of the day. Many parents work or run errands where they will be gone from the house all day with you left to take care of not only the children and any pets they have, but also cook and clean the house. You may also find that if a child gets hurt you will feel guilty for not being around to protect them. Getting them professional help when necessary and noticing when something is wrong is a needed intuitive skill for this position. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caretaking jobs can be taxing mentally as you are either alone in a house with the patent or with noisy kids or pets. Going into this job you have to prepare yourself with strategies to keep calm and composed. But as the children learn to love you, and you love them in return, this job can be one of the most amazing experiences of your life. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4or"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nanny</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love kids, this is the easy weekend job for you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a nanny you would need to know how to take care of children and love them as if they’re your own. You would spend all day with them, tending to their needs, feeding them when they’re hungry, and maybe even putting them to bed before their parents get home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nanny needs to be caring and loving towards the children, willing to spend hours entertaining them and teaching them how to behave while parents are gone. A nanny must have good communication skills, and a background in first aid is a great idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a nanny on the weekend requires working with both the parents and children so getting to know both groups is essential.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average nanny in the US gets paid about $19 for every hour, their weekly salary depends on how much time the parents need the nanny for.

Almost nobody is an inventor or product creator as their full-time job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A product creator job could be taken a thousand different ways and each one is unique because of the person. If you have a talent like making button dolls to hang in cars, or knitting stuffed animals, or making wooden shelves, you could turn that into money by taking orders from across the country and helping someone grow their small business into a thriving market. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller businesses are always looking for people to help them make their products because they don’t have a lot of people to help. For every product that you make and ship off, you could make $12-$20 dollars each item..</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find product making and assembly jobs, look for small businesses on social media, that’s where they do most of their promoting, and email them with an application to get the job. If you have a talent to assemble or build products, this is the job for you. </span></p><p class="align-right">☝🏽 back to <a href="#top">top</a>.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f6t0qpcs4p8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calligraphy Card Designer</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a calligrapher you would write on the front of a card in fancy calligraphy handwriting; then on the back you write the personal message of whatever the employer or customer wants written. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job.webp" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job-xs.webp 300w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job-sm.webp 480w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job-md.webp 768w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job-lg.webp 1024w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job-xl.webp 1360w, https://homeofficepolitics.com/media/posts/21/responsive/calligraphy-card-designer-easy-weekend-job-2xl.webp 1600w" alt="Calligraphy card designer is an easy weekend job" width="960" height="511"><figcaption>Calligraphy card designer is an easy weekend job</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average calligrapher can get paid around $10 an hour but up to $30 as you accumulate more experience.
